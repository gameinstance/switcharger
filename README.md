# switcharger
An arduino simple solar battery charger. It feeds a 12 Volts lead-acid battery from a 30 Watts solar panel. It intends to be a quick and cheap replacement for a true MPPT one. As such, it does NOT employ maximum power point tracking and supports only bulk and float charging modes.

The program should run on any arduino compatible board.
