An arduino simple solar battery charger. It feeds a 12 Volts lead-acid battery from a 30 Watts solar panel and intends to be a quick and cheap replacement for a true MPPT one. As such, it does NOT employ maximum power point tracking and supports only bulk and float charging modes. The program should run on any arduino compatible board.
